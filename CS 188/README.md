# Search

## Uninformed Search

state space, successor function, start state & goal test $\Rightarrow$ solution

Depth-First Search

Breadth-First Search

Uniform Cost Search

## Informed Search

**heuristic**: state $\mapsto$ how close it is to the goal

Greedy

_A\*_ = UCS + Greedy

Admissibility

_A\*_ with admissible heuristic $\rightarrow$ optimality

Graph Search

Consistency

## Constraint Satisfaction Problems

Variables Domains + Constraints $\Rightarrow$ Solution

Backtracking = DFS + variable ordering + fail on violation

- Filtering: Forward Checking (Constraint Propagation); Arc Consistency (AC-3)
- Ordering: Minimum Remaining Values; Least Constraining Value
- Structure:
